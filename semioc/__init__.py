"""SemioCore.

SemioCore is a deterministic, contract-driven toolchain for reproducible
"semiotic auditing": making interpretation regimes explicit, executable, and
comparable under versioned, machine-verifiable contracts.

The public surface is intentionally narrow to preserve determinism,
trace-auditability, and contract stability.
